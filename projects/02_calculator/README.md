# 🧮 Calculator Program

## 📌 Project Description

A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
The program allows the user to choose an operator and enter two numbers, then displays the calculated result.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

* Prompts the user to select an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
* Accepts two numeric inputs
* Performs the selected operation
* Rounds the result to 3 decimal places
* Handles invalid operator input gracefully

---

## ▶️ How to Run It

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd projects/02_calculator
   ```
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Enter the operator and numbers when prompted.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* `input()` function
* Type casting (`float`)
* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Arithmetic operators
* Built-in `round()` function
* Basic error handling (invalid operator case)
